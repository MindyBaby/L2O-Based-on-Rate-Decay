# Learning to Optimize based on Rate Decay
The project conducts comprehensive benchmarking of existing learning optimization methods across different problems. We release the simulated data as experiments to promote reproducible research and fair benchmarking in the L2O field.
### Introuduce
Learning to Optimize (L2O) is a technique that uses machine learning to automatically learn optimization algorithms. Traditional optimization algorithms, such as SGD and Adam, are typically designed based on predefined rules and assumptions, whereas L2O learns how to optimize in a data-driven manner, adapting the optimization strategy according to the specific characteristics of the problem.
### The core idea of L2O
The core idea of L2O is to train a neural network to automatically learn how to select the appropriate optimization algorithm for a given optimization task. In other words, L2O attempts to replace traditional hand-designed optimization algorithms by allowing the machine to learn from historical data how to handle different optimization problems.
